# Changelog

### Changes
- Removed webacceleration profile from pua-webtop VIP

## [1.0.25] 20190315
### Changes
- No ping check on 0.0.0.0 addresses (for catchall type VIPs)

### Addded
- -n/--nobackup option to not create UCS file, `nobackup=true` in unattended or `pua_config.sh`

## [1.0.24] 20190215
### Changes
- Script overwrites workspace archives in /var/ilx/ if they already exist (this really shouldn't happen normally, but does just in case)
- IP address checking for mgmt now uses `ip show` vs `ifconfig` for future compatibility

### Added
- On successful completion, /root/.puaversion created with the current version installed. this is for later use
- upgrade option, -u will allow one to upgrade the workspaces in an exisitng installation. The script first checks to see if the installed version is older than the one in the package. Fixes [#25](../../issues/25)
- new options
  - -h / --help - basic help
  - -u / --upgrade - upgrade exisitng PUA workspaces/plugins
  - -c / --checkonly - check installed workspace versions against whats included in the package

## [1.0.23] 20190214 Happy Valentines Day! 
### Changes
- Script now creates a UCS before any operations are done, while this should be a best practice before installing any software, it's done here as a safety measure. [#23](../../issues/23)
- Reorder checking of ILX workspaces before asking for IP information

## [1.0.22] 20190212
### Changes
- Distribution changes only. Moved from seperate online/offline versions of the script to just the "offline" with embedded workspaces. Shouldn't really mean anything for anyone, just noting the change for past users in case they are looking for the "offline" version. Now `build_pua.(zip|sh)` is the offline and only version.
